# Goal / Purpose

Some NFTs are very expensive and impossible to purchase alone such as metaheros($10k floor price). This NFT pools 80% of initial sales and 75% of secondary sales to purchase a metahero nft. The metahero will be staked for pow tokens and users will be allowed to vote on when to sell all assets.

# Future Plans
Stake all purchased metaheros and develop a system for users to vote, maybe using snapshot or create another smart contract. Sell all assets when the users desire and create a payment splitter smart contract for all users to withdraw their funds within the alloted time period.
