    question: "WHAT IS LAVA LAMPS NFT?",
    answer: "Lava Lamps NFT is a collection of 7,979 revamped NFT’s plus an additional 278 NFT’s from our original project. Each is a unique digital collectible stored on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-721 token. Your Lava Lamp NFT doubles as a share in the Lava Pool.",
  },
  {
    question: "WHAT IS THE LAVA POOL?",
    answer: "The Lava Pool is our way of giving back to all community members. Upon selling out, we will use 50% of the proceeds from the sale to purchase Metaheros. These Metaheros will then be staked for $POW. We will then add 33% of our monthly Open Sea fees to the Lava Pool to purchase more NFTs.",
  },
  {
    question: "THE FLOOR IS LAVA!",
    answer: "We mean that literally. Each month 33% of our Open Sea fees will be used to buy and burn Lava Lamps! This will reduce supply and means each Lava Lamp gets a bigger share in the Lava Pool over time.",
  },
  {
    question: "WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?",
    answer: "We currently have whitelist spots open. You can join our discord to be given a whitelist spot. Our sale will start on February 4th at 8pm EST and will be priced at .03 eth. It will be open to WL members for 1 hour and then public thereafter. Once live we will have a section on lavalamps.io where you can see real time data on Lava Lamps in circulation and NFTs in the Lava Pool. Move quickly, the floor is Lava!",
